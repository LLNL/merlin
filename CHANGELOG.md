# Changelog
All notable changes to Merlin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.1]

### Fixed
- Error if app.yaml does not have visibility timeout seconds

## [1.6.0]

### Added
- The broker name can now be amqps (with ssl) or amqp (without ssl). 
- The encryption key will now be created when running merlin config.
- The merlin info connection check will now enforce a minute timeout 
  check for the server connections.

### Fixed
- Added a check for initial running workers when using merlin monitor to
  eliminate race condition.
- A bug that did not change the filename of the output workspace nor of the provenance spec
  when a user variable was included in the `description.name` field.
- Temporarily locked Celery version at 4.4.2 to avoid fatal bug.
  
### Changed
- The default rabbitmq vhost is now <user> instead of /<user>.
- Changed default visibility timeout from 2 hours to 24 hours. Exposed this in the config
  file.
- The monitor function will now check the queues to determine when
  to exit.

## [1.5.3]

### Fixed
- Temporarily locked maestro version to avoid fatal bug introduced by maestro v1.1.7.

## [1.5.2]

### Added
- A faq entry for --mpibind when using slurm on LC.
- Version of the openfoam workflow that works without docker.
- In 'merlin examples', a version of the openfoam workflow that works without docker.

### Fixed
- The batch system will now check LSB_MCPU_HOSTS to determine the number
  of nodes on blueos systems in case LSB_HOSTS is not present.
- A few typos, partially finished material, and developer comments in the tutorials.
- PEP-8 violations like unused imports, bad formatting, broken code.
- A bug where the batch shell was not overriding the default.

### Changed
- Removed mysql dependencies and added sqlalchemy to the celery module.
- Removed mysql install from travis.
- Improved the celery worker error messages.
- The slurm launch for celery workers no longer uses the --pty option,
  this can be added by setting launch_args in the batch section. 
- Adjusted wording in openfoam_wf_no_docker example.

## [1.5.1]

### Added
- merlin example `null_spec`, which may be used to generate overhead data for merlin.

### Fixed
- The task creation bottleneck.
- Bug that caused the `cmd` stdout and stderr files of a step to be overwritten by that same step's `restart`
  section.

### Changed
- Updated tutorial docs.
- Relocated code that ran upon import from file body to functions. Added the respective
  function calls.

## [1.5.0]

### Added
- `HelpParser`, which automatically prints help messages when command line commands return an error.
- Optional ssl files for the broker and results backend config.
- A url keyword in the app.yaml file to override the entire broker or results backend configuration.
- The `all` option to `batch.nodes`.
- Auto zero-padding of sample directories, e.g. 00/00, 00/01 .. 10/10
- `$(MERLIN_STOP_WORKERS)` exit code that shuts down all workers
- The `merlin monitor` command, which blocks while celery workers are running.
  This can be used at the end of a batch submission script to keep the
  allocation alive while workers are present.  
- The ~/.merlin dir will be searched for the results password. 
- A warning whenever an unrecognized key is found in a Merlin spec; this may
  help users find small mistakes due to spelling or indentation more quickly.

### Fixed
- Bug that prevented an empty username for results backend and broker when using redis.
- Bug that prevented `OUTPUT_PATH` from being an integer.
- Slow sample speed in `hello_samples.yaml` from the hello example.
- Bug that always had sample directory tree start with "0"
- "Error" message whenever a non-zero return code is given
- The explicit results password (when not a file) will be read if certs path is None and it will be stripped of any whitespace.
- Misleading log message for `merlin run-workers --echo`.
- A few seconds of lag that occurred in all merlin cli commands; merlin was always searching
  thru workflow examples, even when user's command had nothing to do with workflow examples.

### Changed
- Updated docs from `pip3 install merlinwf` to `pip3 install merlin`.
- Script launching uses Merlin submission instead of subclassing maestro submit
- `$(MERLIN_HARD_FAIL)` now shuts down only workers connected to the bad step's queue
- Updated all tutorial modules

## [1.4.1] [2020-03-06]

### Changed
- Updated various aspects of tutorial documentation.

## [1.4.0] 2020-03-02

### Added
- The walltime keyword is now enabled for the slurm and flux batch types.
- LAUNCHER keywords, (slurm,flux,lsf) for specifying arguments specific
  to that parallel launcher in the run section.
- Exception messages to `merlin info`.
- Preliminary tutorial modules for early testers.

### Removed
- The problematic step `stop_workers` in `feature_demo.yaml`.

### Fixed
- Syntax errors in web doc file `merlin_variables.rst`.

### Removed
- The exclusive and signal keywords and bind for slurm in a step. The bind
  keyword is now lsf only.

## [1.3.0] 2020-02-21

### Added
- cli test flag `--local`, which can be used in place of listing out the id of each
  local cli test.
- A Merlin Dockerfile and some accompanying web documentation.
- Makefile target `release`.
- The merlin config now takes an optional --broker argument, the
  value can be None, default rabbitmq broker, or redis for a redis
  local broker.
- Missing doc options for run and run-workers.
- Check server access when `merlin info` is run.
- A port option to rabbitmq config options.
- Author and author_email to setup.py.

### Removed
- Makefile targets `pull` and `update`.
- Unneeded variables from `simple_chain.yaml`.
- All `INFO`-level logger references to Celery.

### Changed
- Updated the Merlin Sphinx web docs, including info about command line commands.
- Example workflows use python3 instead of python.
- Updated `merlin info` to lookup python3 and and pip3.
- Altered user in Dockerfile and removed build tools.
- MANIFEST.in now uses recursive-include.
- Updated docker docs.
- `make clean` is more comprehensive, now cleans docs, build files, and release files.
- The celery keyword is no longer required in `app.yaml`.

## [1.2.3] 2020-01-27

### Changed
- Adjusted `maestrowf` requirement to `maestrowf>=1.1.7dev0`.

## [1.2.2] 2020-01-24

### Removed
- Unused directory `workflows/` at the top level (not to be confused with
  `merlin/examples/workflows/`)

### Fixed
- Bug related to missing package `merlin/examples/workflows` in PYPI distribution.

## [1.2.1] 2020-01-24

### Fixed
- Bug related to a missing path in `MANIFEST.in`.
- Error message when trying to run merlin without the app config file.

## [1.2.0] 2020-01-23

### Added
- `version_tests.sh`, for CI checking that the merlin version is incremented
  before changes are merged into master.
- Allow for the maestro `$(LAUNCHER)` syntax in tasks, this requires the 
  nodes and procs variables in the task just as in maestro. The LAUNCHER keyword
  is implemented for flux, lsf, slurm and local types.  The lsf type
  will use the LLNL srun wrapper for jsrun when the lsf-srun batch type 
  is used. The flux version will be checked to determine the proper format 
  of the parallel launch call.
- Local CLI tests for the above `$(LAUNCHER)` feature.
- `machines` keyword, in the `merlin.resources.workers.<name>` section. This allows
  the user to assign workers (and thence, steps) to a given machine. 
  All of the machines must have access to the `OUTPUT_PATH`, The
  steps list is mandatory for all workers. Once the machines are added, then only
  the workers for the given set of steps on the specific machine will start. The
  workers must be individually started on all of the listed machines separately by
  the user (`merlin run-workers`).
- New step field `restart`. This command runs when merlin receives a
  `$(MERLIN_RESTART)` exception. If no `restart` field is found, the `cmd`
  command re-runs instead.

### Fixed
- A bug in the `flux_test` example workflow.

### Changed
- Improved the `fix-style` dev Makefile target.
- Improved the `version` dev Makefile target.
- Updated travis logic.
- `MERLIN_RESTART` (which re-ran the `cmd` of a step) has been renamed to `MERLIN_RETRY`.
