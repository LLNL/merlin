## [1.4.0] 2020-03-02

### Added
- The walltime keyword is now enabled for the slurm and flux batch types.
- LAUNCHER keywords, (slurm,flux,lsf) for specifying arguments specific
  to that parallel launcher in the run section.
- Exception messages to `merlin info`.
- Preliminary tutorial modules for early testers.

### Removed
- The problematic step `stop_workers` in `feature_demo.yaml`.

### Fixed
- Syntax errors in web doc file `merlin_variables.rst`.

### Removed
- The exclusive and signal keywords and bind for slurm in a step. The bind
  keyword is now lsf only.

## [1.3.0] 2020-02-21

### Added
- cli test flag `--local`, which can be used in place of listing out the id of each
  local cli test.
- A Merlin Dockerfile and some accompanying web documentation.
- Makefile target `release`.
- The merlin config now takes an optional --broker argument, the
  value can be None, default rabbitmq broker, or redis for a redis
  local broker.
- Missing doc options for run and run-workers.
- Check server access when `merlin info` is run.
- A port option to rabbitmq config options.
- Author and author_email to setup.py.

### Removed
- Makefile targets `pull` and `update`.
- Unneeded variables from `simple_chain.yaml`.
- All `INFO`-level logger references to Celery.

### Changed
- Updated the Merlin Sphinx web docs, including info about command line commands.
- Example workflows use python3 instead of python.
- Updated `merlin info` to lookup python3 and and pip3.
- Altered user in Dockerfile and removed build tools.
- MANIFEST.in now uses recursive-include.
- Updated docker docs.
- `make clean` is more comprehensive, now cleans docs, build files, and release files.
- The celery keyword is no longer required in `app.yaml`.

## [1.2.3] 2020-01-27

### Changed
- Adjusted `maestrowf` requirement to `maestrowf>=1.1.7dev0`.

## [1.2.2] 2020-01-24

### Removed
- Unused directory `workflows/` at the top level (not to be confused with
  `merlin/examples/workflows/`)

### Fixed
- Bug related to missing package `merlin/examples/workflows` in PYPI distribution.

## [1.2.1] 2020-01-24

### Fixed
- Bug related to a missing path in `MANIFEST.in`.
- Error message when trying to run merlin without the app config file.

## [1.2.0] 2020-01-23

### Added
- `version_tests.sh`, for CI checking that the merlin version is incremented
  before changes are merged into master.
- Allow for the maestro `$(LAUNCHER)` syntax in tasks, this requires the 
  nodes and procs variables in the task just as in maestro. The LAUNCHER keyword
  is implmented for flux, lsf, slurm and local types.  The lsf type
  will use the LLNL srun wrapper for jsrun when the lsf-srun batch type 
  is used. The flux version will be checked to determine the proper format 
  of the parallel launch call.
- Local CLI tests for the above `$(LAUNCHER)` feature.
- `machines` keyword, in the `merlin.resources.workers.<name>` section. This allows
  the user to assign workers (and thence, steps) to a given machine. 
  All of the machines must have access to the `OUTPUT_PATH`, The
  steps list is mandatory for all workers. Once the machines are added, then only
  the workers for the given set of steps on the specific machine will start. The
  workers must be individually started on all of the listed machines separately by
  the user (`merlin run-workers`).
- New step field `restart`. This command runs when merlin receives a
  `$(MERLIN_RESTART)` exception. If no `restart` field is found, the `cmd`
  command re-runs instead.

### Fixed
- A bug in the `flux_test` example workflow.

### Changed
- Improved the `fix-style` dev Makefile target.
- Improved the `version` dev Makefile target.
- Updated travis logic.
- `MERLIN_RESTART` (which re-ran the `cmd` of a step) has been renamed to `MERLIN_RETRY`.

### Added
- A changelog!
- Templated workflows generator. See `merlin-templates`
- Steps in any language. Set with study.step.run.shell in spec file. For instance:
```
    - name: python2_hello
      description: |
          do something in python2
      run:
          cmd: |
            print "OMG is this in python2?"
            print "Variable X2 is $(X2)"
          shell: /usr/bin/env python2
          task_queue: pyth2_hello
```
- Integration testing `make cli-tests`
- Style rules (isort and black). See `make check-style` and `make fix-style`
- Dry-run ability for workflows, which will cause workers to setup workspaces, 
but skip execution (all variables will be expanded). Eg: `merlin run --local --dry-run`.
- Command line override of variable names. `merlin run --vars OUTPUT_PATH=/run/here/instead`

### Changed
- MerlinSpec class subclasses from Maestro
