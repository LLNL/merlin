"""
Factory for registering and instantiating individual Merlin worker implementations.

This module defines the `WorkerFactory`, a subclass of
[`MerlinBaseFactory`][abstracts.factory.MerlinBaseFactory], which manages
the registration, validation, and creation of concrete worker classes such as
[`CeleryWorker`][workers.celery_worker.CeleryWorker]. It supports plugin-based discovery
via Python entry points, enabling extensibility for other task server backends (e.g., Kafka).

The factory ensures that all registered components conform to the `MerlinWorker` interface
and provides useful utilities such as aliasing and error handling for unsupported components.
