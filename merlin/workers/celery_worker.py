"""
Implements a Celery-based MerlinWorker.

This module defines the `CeleryWorker` class, which extends the abstract
`MerlinWorker` base class to implement worker launching and management using
Celery. Celery workers are responsible for processing tasks from specified queues
and can be launched either locally or through a batch system.

    Concrete implementation of a single Celery-based Merlin worker.

    This class provides logic for validating configuration, constructing launch

    jobs from specific task queues.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the worker.
        config (dict): Configuration settings for the worker.
        env (dict): Environment variables used by the worker process.
        args (str): Additional CLI arguments passed to Celery.

        batch (dict): Optional batch submission settings.
        machines (List[str]): List of hostnames the worker is allowed to run on.
        overlap (bool): Whether this worker can overlap queues with others.

    Methods:
        _verify_args: Validate and adjust CLI args based on worker setup.
        get_launch_command: Construct the Celery launch command.
        should_launch: Determine whether the worker should be launched based on system state.
