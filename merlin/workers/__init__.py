"""
Worker framework for managing task execution in Merlin.

The `workers` package defines the core abstractions and implementations for launching
and managing task server workers in the Merlin workflow framework. It includes an
extensible system for defining worker behavior, instantiating worker instances, and
handling task server-specific logic (e.g., Celery, Kafka).

This package supports a plugin-based architecture through factories, allowing new
task server backends to be added seamlessly via Python entry points.

Subpackages:
    - `handlers/`: Defines the interface and implementations for worker handler classes
        responsible for launching and managing groups of workers.

Modules:
    worker.py: Defines the `MerlinWorker` abstract base class, which represents a single
        task server worker and provides a common interface for launching and
        configuring worker instances.
    celery_worker.py: Implements `CeleryWorker`, a concrete subclass of `MerlinWorker` that uses
        Celery to process tasks from configured queues. Supports local and batch launch modes.
    kafka_worker.py: Implements `KafkaWorker`, a concrete subclass of `MerlinWorker` that uses
        Apache Kafka to process tasks from configured topics. Provides backend independence alternative.
    worker_factory.py: Defines the `WorkerFactory`, which manages the registration, validation,
        and instantiation of individual worker implementations such as `CeleryWorker` and `KafkaWorker`.
        Supports plugin discovery via entry points.
