"""
Worker handler interface and implementations for Merlin task servers.

The `handlers` package defines the extensible framework for managing task server
workers in Merlin. It includes an abstract base interface, a concrete implementation
for Celery, and a factory for dynamic registration and instantiation of worker handlers.

This design allows Merlin to support multiple task server backends through a consistent
interface while enabling future integration with additional systems such as Kafka.

Modules:
    handler_factory.py: Factory for registering and instantiating Merlin worker
        handler implementations.
    worker_handler.py: Abstract base class that defines the interface for all Merlin
        worker handlers.
    celery_handler.py: Celery-specific implementation of the worker handler interface.
