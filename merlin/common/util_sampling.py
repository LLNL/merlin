def scale_samples(samples_norm, limits, limits_norm=(0, 1), do_log=False):
    """Scale samples to new limits, either log10 or linearly.

    Args:
        samples_norm (ndarray): The normalized samples to scale,
            with dimensions (nsamples,ndims).
        limits (list of tuples): A list of (min, max) for the various
            dimensions. Length of list is ndims.
        limits_norm (tuple of floats, optional): The (min, max) from which
            samples_norm were drawn. Defaults to (0,1).
        do_log (boolean or list of booleans, optional): Whether
            to log10 scale each dimension. Either a single boolean or
            a list of length ndims, for each dimension.
            Defaults to ndims*[False].

    Returns:
        ndarray: The scaled samples.

    Note:
        We follow the sklearn convention of requiring samples to be
        given as an (nsamples, ndims) array.

        To transform 1-D arrays:

        >>> samples = samples.reshape((-1,1)) # ndims = 1
        >>> samples = samples.reshape((1,-1)) # nsamples = 1

    Example:

        >>> # Turn 0:1 samples into -1:1
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> norm_values = np.linspace(0,1,5).reshape((-1,1))
        >>> real_values = scale_samples(norm_values, [(-1,1)])
        >>> print(real_values)
        [[-1. ]
         [-0.5]
         [ 0. ]
         [ 0.5]
         [ 1. ]]
        >>> # Logarithmically scale to 1:10000
        >>> real_values = scale_samples(norm_values, [(1,1e4)] do_log=True)
        >>> print(real_values)
        [[  1.00000000e+00]
         [  1.00000000e+01]
         [  1.00000000e+02]
         [  1.00000000e+03]
         [  1.00000000e+04]]
