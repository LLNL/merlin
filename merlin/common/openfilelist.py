  OpenFileList

  A synthetic file class that opens a list of files and reads them as if they
  were a single file

  SYNOPSIS:

    with OpenFileList(["file1.txt","file2.txt",...]) as f :
      print f.read();

  reads the concatenation of file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.

  file methods supported :

    f.read([bytes])
    f.readlines([bytes])
    f.readline([bytes])
    f.tell()
    f.close()
    f.__iter__()

  TODO:
    implement a seek method
