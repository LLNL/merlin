# Querying Queues and Workers

Managing task queues and monitoring the associated workers is a common necessity in many applications. To facilitate these interactions, Merlin offers two essential commands â€“ [Queue Information](#queue-information) and [Query Workers](#query-workers).

This module will delve into the details of these commands, providing insights into how to effectively retrieve information about task queues and query workers.

## Queue Information

Merlin provides users with the [`merlin queue-info`](../command_line.md#queue-info-merlin-queue-info) command to help monitor celery queues. This command will list queue statistics in a table format where the columns are as follows: queue name, number of tasks in the queue, number of workers connected to the queue.

The default functionality of this command is to display queue statistics for active queues. Active queues are any queues that have a worker watching them.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info
```

      <figcaption>Output of Queue-Info When There Are Queues Active</figcaption>
    </figure>

### Basic Options

The `queue-info` command comes equipped with some basic options:

- [`--dump`](#dump): Dump the queue information to a `.csv` or `.json` file
- [`--specific-queues`](#specific-queues): Only obtain queue information for queues you list here
- [`--task-server`](#task-server): Modify the task server value

#### Dump

Much like [the two status commands](./status_cmds.md), the `queue-info` command provides a way to dump the queue statistics to an output file.

=== "CSV Usage"

    ```bash
    merlin queue-info --dump queue_report.csv
    ```

=== "JSON Usage"

    ```bash
    merlin queue-info --dump queue_report.json
    ```

When dumping to a file that *does not* yet exist, Merlin will create that file for you and populate it with the queue statistics you requested.

When dumping to a file that *does* exist, Merlin will append the requested queue statistics to that file. You can differentiate between separate dump calls by looking at the timestamps of the dumps. For CSV files this timestamp exists in the `Time` column (see [CSV Dump Format](#csv-dump-format) below) and for JSON files this timestamp will be the top level key to the queue info entry (see [JSON Dump Format](#json-dump-format) below).

Using any of the `--specific-steps`, `--spec`, or `--steps` options will modify the output that's written to the output file.

##### CSV Dump Format

The format of a CSV dump file for queue information is as follows:

```bash
Time,[merlin]_<queue_name>:tasks,[merlin]_<queue_name>:consumers
```

The `<queue_name>:tasks` and `<queue_name>:consumers` columns will be created for each queue that's listed in the queue-info output at the time of your dump.

The image below shows an example of dumping the queue statistics of active queues to a csv file, and then displaying that csv file using the [rich-cli library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich-cli):

  <figcaption>An Example Showcasing How to do a CSV Dump of Active Queue Stats</figcaption>
</figure>

##### JSON Dump Format

The format of a JSON dump file for queue information is as follows:

```json
{ 
    "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS": {
        "[merlin]_queue_name": {
            "tasks": <integer>,
            "consumers": <integer>
        }
    }
}
```

The image below shows an example of dumping the queue info to a json file, and then displaying that json file using the [rich-cli library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich-cli):

  <figcaption>An Example Showcasing How to do a JSON Dump of Active Queue Stats</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Specific Queues

If you know exactly what queues you want to check on, you can use the `--specific-queues` option to list one or more queues to view.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info --specific-queues <space-delimited list of queue names>
```

??? example "Example Queue-Info Output Using Specific-Queues With Active Queues"

    In the example below, we're querying the `train` and `predict` queues which both have a worker watching them currently (in other words, they are _**active**_).

    <figure markdown>
      ![the queue-info output using the specific-queues option with active queues](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/specific-queues-active.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Queue-Info Using the Specific-Queues Option With Active Queues</figcaption>
    </figure>

If you ask for queue-info of inactive queues with the `--specific-queues` option, a table format will still be output for you.

??? example "Example Queue-Info Output Using Specific-Queues With Inactive Queues"

    In the example below, we're querying the `train` and `predict` queues which both *don't* have a worker watching them currently (in other words, they are _**inactive**_).

    <figure markdown>
      ![the queue-info output using the specific-queues option with inactive queues](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/specific-queues-inactive.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Queue-Info Using the Specific-Queues Option With Inactive Queues</figcaption>
    </figure>

#### Task Server

To modify the task server from the command line you can use the `--task-server` option. However, the only currently available option for task server is celery so you most likely will not want to use this option.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info --task-server <new task server>
```

### Specification Options

There are three options with the `--queue-info` command that revolve around using a spec file to query queue information:

- [`--spec`](#spec): Obtain queue information for all queues defined in a spec file
- [`--steps`](#steps): Obtain queue information for queues attached to certain steps in a spec file
- [`--vars`](#vars): Modify environment variables in a spec from the command line

!!! note

    The `--steps` and `--vars` options *must* be used alongside the `--spec` option. They *cannot* be used by themselves.

#### Spec

Using the `--spec` option allows you to query queue statistics for queues that only exist in the spec file you provide. This is the same functionality as the `merlin status` command prior to the release of Merlin v1.12.0.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info --spec <spec file>
```

!!! example "Example Queue-Info Output Using the `--spec` Option"

    The below example will display queue information for all queues in the `hello.yaml` spec file.

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Queue-Info When Using the Specification Option](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/specification-option.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Queue-Info When Using the Specification Option</figcaption>
    </figure>

#### Steps

!!! warning

    This option *must* be used alongside the [`--spec`](#spec) option.

If you'd like to see queue information for queues that are attached to specific steps in your workflow, use the `--steps` option.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info --spec <spec file> --steps <space-delimited list of step names>
```

!!! example "Example Queue-Info Output Using the `--steps` Option"

    Say we have a spec file with steps named `step_1` through `step_4` and each step is attached to a different task queue `step_1_queue` through `step_4_queue` respectively. Using the `--steps` option for these two steps gives us:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Queue-Info When Using the Steps Option](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/steps-option.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Queue-Info When Using the Steps Option</figcaption>
    </figure>

#### Vars

!!! warning

    This option *must* be used alongside the [`--spec`](#spec) option.

The `--vars` option can be used to modify any variables defined in your spec file from the command line interface. This option can take a space-delimited list of variables and their assignments, and should be given after the input yaml file.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin queue-info --spec <spec file> --vars <VAR_TO_MODIFY>=<VAL_TO_SET>
```

??? example "Example of Using `--vars` With Queue-Info"

    Say we have the following spec file with a variable `QUEUE_NAME` that's referenced in `step_2`:

    ```yaml title="vars_demo.yaml" hl_lines="7 22"
    description:
        name: vars_demo
        description: a very simple merlin workflow

    env:
        variables:
            QUEUE_NAME: step_2_queue

    study:
        - name: step_1
          description: say hello
          run:
            cmd: echo "hello!"
            task_queue: step_1_queue

        - name: step_2
          description: print a success message
          run:
            cmd: print("Hurrah, we did it!")
            depends: [step_1_*]
            shell: /usr/bin/env python3
            task_queue: $(QUEUE_NAME)
    ```

    If we decided we wanted to modify this queue at the command line, we could accomplish this with the `--vars` option of the [`merlin run`](../command_line.md#run-merlin-run) and [`merlin run-workers`](../command_line.md#run-workers-merlin-run-workers) commands:

    === "Run"

        ```bash
        merlin run vars_demo.yaml --vars QUEUE_NAME=new_queue_name
        ```

    === "Run Workers"

        ```bash
        merlin run-workers vars_demo.yaml --vars QUEUE_NAME=new_queue_name
        ```

    Now if we were to try to query the queue information without using the same `--vars` argument:
    
    ```bash
    merlin queue-info --spec vars_demo.yaml
    ```

    ...we see `step_1_queue` and `step_2_queue` but we wouldn't see `new_queue_name`:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Demo Output Showing The Missing 'new_queue_name' Queue](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/queue-info-no-vars.png)
      <figcaption>Demo Output Showing The Missing 'new_queue_name' Queue</figcaption>
    </figure>

    This is due to the fact that when we modify a variable from the command line, the original spec file is not changed.

    With that being said, let's now run this again but this time we'll use the `--vars` option:

    ```bash
    merlin queue-info --spec vars_demo.yaml --vars QUEUE_NAME=new_queue_name
    ```

    ...which should show us a worker watching the `new_queue_name` queue:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Demo Output Showcasing 'new_queue_name' Appearing as Expected](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/queue-info-with-vars.png)
      <figcaption>Demo Output Showcasing 'new_queue_name' Appearing as Expected</figcaption>
    </figure>

## Query Workers

Merlin provides users with the [`merlin query-workers`](../command_line.md#query-workers-merlin-query-workers) command to help users see which workers are running and what task queues they're watching.

This command will output content to a table format with two columns: workers and queues. The workers column will contain one connected worker per row. The queues column will contain a comma-delimited list of queues that the connected worker is watching.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin query-workers
```

??? example "Example Query-Workers Output With No Connected Workers"

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Query-Workers When No Workers Are Connected](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/no-connected-workers.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Query-Workers When No Workers Are Connected</figcaption>
    </figure>

??? example "Example Query-Workers Output With Connected Workers"

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Query-Workers When There Are Workers Connected](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/connected-workers.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Query-Workers When There Are Workers Connected</figcaption>
    </figure>

### Query Workers by Spec File

When utilizing the `--spec` option with the `query-workers` command, your query will be adjusted to exclusively search for the workers specified in the provided spec file. If none of the workers defined in the spec file have been started, a message indicating this will be displayed.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin query-workers --spec <spec file>
```

??? example "Example of Using the `--spec` Option With Query-Workers"

    For this example let's start with two spec files `demo_workflow.yaml` and `demo_workflow_2.yaml`. In `demo_workflow.yaml` we'll have two workers `trainer` and `predictor`, and in `demo_workflow_2.yaml` we'll have one worker `worker1`.

    === "demo_workflow.yaml"

        Here, the `trainer` worker is watching the `create_data` and `train` steps which both have task queues of the same name. Therefore, the `trainer` worker will be watching the `create_data` and `train` task queues. Similarly, the `predictor` worker will be watching the `predict` and `verify` task queues.

        ```yaml title="demo_workflow.yaml" hl_lines="10 16 22 28 33-38"
        description:
            name: demo_workflow
            description: a very simple merlin workflow

        study:
            - name: create_data
              description: create data for our model to train with
              run:
                cmd: echo "creating data"
                task_queue: create_data

            - name: train
              description: train a model
              run:
                cmd: echo "training a model on the data"
                task_queue: train

            - name: predict
              description: predict on unseen data
              run:
                cmd: echo "predict on new, unseen data"
                task_queue: predict

            - name: verify
              description: verify the validity of our study
              run:
                cmd: echo "verify our study succeeded"
                task_queue: verify

        merlin:
            resources:
                workers:
                    trainer:
                        args: -l INFO
                        steps: [create_data, train]
                    predictor:
                        args: -l INFO
                        steps: [predict, verify]
        ```

    === "demo_workflow_2.yaml"

        In this workflow, the `worker1` worker is assigned to both `step_1` and `step_2`. Therefore, this worker will be connected to both `step_1_queue` and `step_2_queue`.

        ```yaml title="demo_workflow_2.yaml" hl_lines="23 31 36-38"
        description:
            name: $(NAME)
            description: a very simple merlin workflow

        env:
            variables:
                NAME: hello
                OUTPUT_PATH: ./studies

        global.parameters:
            GREET:
                values : ["hello","hola"]
                label  : GREET.%%
            WORLD:
                values : ["world","mundo"]
                label  : WORLD.%%

        study:
            - name: step_1
              description: say hello
              run:
                cmd: echo "$(GREET), $(WORLD)!"
                task_queue: step_1_queue

            - name: step_2
              description: print a success message
              run:
                cmd: print("Hurrah, we did it!")
                depends: [step_1_*]
                shell: /usr/bin/env python3
                task_queue: step_2_queue

        merlin:
            resources:
                workers:
                    worker1:
                        args: -l INFO
                        steps: [all]
        ```

    Let's start these workers with:

    === "Start Workers for `demo_workflow.yaml`"

        ```bash
        merlin run-workers demo_workflow.yaml
        ```

    === "Start Workers for `demo_workflow_2.yaml`"

        ```bash
        merlin run-workers demo_workflow_2.yaml
        ```

    Now if we used the `query-workers` command without the `--spec` option, we'd see all three workers across both workflows: `trainer`, `predictor`, and `worker1`:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Workers Across Multiple Spec Files](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/query-workers-spec-all-workers.png)
      <figcaption>Example of Workers Queried Across Multiple Spec Files</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Great, but what if we wanted to see just the workers for `demo_workflow.yaml`? We can accomplish this by using the `--spec` option:

    ```bash
    merlin query-workers --spec demo_workflow.yaml
    ```

    Now, we'll notice that the only workers being displayed are `trainer` and `predictor`:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Query-Workers Using the Spec Option](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/query-workers-spec-option.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Query-Workers Using the Spec Option</figcaption>
    </figure>

### Query Workers by Queues

In Merlin, newly spawned workers are linked to task queues either as assigned by you or automatically designated if not specified. Utilizing the `--queues` option in the `query-workers` command enables you to query workers based on the queues to which they are connected.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin query-workers --queues <space-delimited list of task queues>
```

??? example "Example of Using the `--queues` Option With Query-Workers"

    Say we have the below spec file with four workers `creator`, `trainer`, `predictor`, and `verifier` that are each attached to their respective steps/task queues. In other words, `creator` will be connected to the `create_data` task queue, `trainer` will be connected to the `train` task queue, etc.:

    ```yaml title="demo_workflow.yaml" hl_lines="33-44"
    description:
        name: demo_workflow
        description: a very simple merlin workflow

    study:
        - name: create_data
          description: create data for our model to train with
          run:
            cmd: echo "creating data"
            task_queue: create_data

        - name: train
          description: train a model
          run:
            cmd: echo "training a model on the data"
            task_queue: train

        - name: predict
          description: predict on unseen data
          run:
            cmd: echo "predict on new, unseen data"
            task_queue: predict

        - name: verify
          description: verify the validity of our study
          run:
            cmd: echo "verify our study succeeded"
            task_queue: verify

    merlin:
        resources:
            workers:
                creator:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [create_data]
                trainer:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [train]
                predictor:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [predict]
                verifier:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [verify]
    ```

    We can start these workers with:

    ```bash
    merlin run-workers demo_workflow.yaml
    ```

    Now if we query the workers *without* the `--queues` option, we'll see all four workers alive and connected to their respective queues:

    <figure markdown>
      ![All Four Workers From 'demo_workflow.yaml' Being Queried](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/queues-example-all-workers.png)
      <figcaption>All Four Workers From 'demo_workflow.yaml' Being Queried</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Let's refine this query to just view the workers connected to the `train` and `predict` queues:

    ```bash
    merlin query-workers --queues train predict
    ```

    As we can see in the output below, only the `trainer` and `predictor` workers are now displayed:

    <figure markdown>
      ![Output of Query-Workers Using the Queues Option](../../assets/images/monitoring/queues_and_workers/queues-example-filtered-workers.png)
      <figcaption>Output of Query-Workers Using the Queues Option</figcaption>
    </figure>

### Query Workers by Worker Regex

There will be instances when you know precisely which workers you want to query. In such cases, the `--workers` option in the `query-workers` command proves useful. This option facilitates querying workers using [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). As full strings are accepted as regular expressions, you can also query workers by worker name.

**Usage:**

```bash
merlin query-workers --workers <space-delimited list of regular expressions>
```

??? example "Example of Using the `--workers` Option With Query-Workers"

    Say we have the following spec file with 3 workers `step_1_worker`, `step_2_worker`, and `other_worker`:

    ```yaml title="demo_workflow.yaml" hl_lines="27-35"
    description:
        name: demo_workflow
        description: a very simple merlin workflow

    study:
        - name: step_1
          description: A step following the `step_*` name pattern
          run:
            cmd: echo "step 1"
            task_queue: step_1_queue

        - name: step_2
          description: A step following the `step_*` name pattern
          run:
            cmd: echo "step 2"
            task_queue: step_2_queue

        - name: other_step
          description: A step with a different name
          run:
            cmd: echo "other step"
            task_queue: predict

    merlin:
        resources:
            workers:
                step_1_worker:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [step_1]
                step_2_worker:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [step_2]
                other_worker:
                    args: -l INFO
                    steps: [other_step]
    ```

    Once the workers are started for this workflow, we can then query for our `step_1_worker` and `step_2_worker` with:

    ```bash
    merlin query-workers --workers step_1_worker step_2_worker
    ```

    In our output we see that both workers that we asked for were queried but `other_worker` was ignored:

      <figcaption>Output of Query-Workers Using the Workers Option With Worker Names</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Alternatively, we can do the exact same query using a regular expression:

    ```bash
    merlin query-workers --workers ^step
    ```

    The `^` operator for regular expressions will match the beginning of a string. In this example when we say `^step` we're asking Merlin to match any worker starting with the word `step`, which in this case is `step_1_worker` and `step_2_worker`. We can see this in the output below:
