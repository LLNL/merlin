# Monitoring Studies

This section of the documentation is dedicated to guiding you through the intricacies of monitoring studies with Merlin. From utilizing monitoring tools to interpreting their outputs, we'll explore how to leverage Merlin's monitoring features to enhance your study management experience.

## Key Objectives

1. **Real-Time Visibility**

    - Gain instant insights into the progress of your studies.

    - Monitor the status of individual tasks and their dependencies.

2. **Issue Identification and Resolution**

    - Identify and address issues or bottlenecks in study execution promptly.
    
    - Utilize monitoring data for efficient troubleshooting.

3. **Performance Optimization**

    - Analyze historical data to identify patterns and optimize study workflows.
    
    - Fine-tune parameters based on monitoring insights for enhanced efficiency.

## What is in This Section?

There are several commands used specifically for monitoring studies (see [Monitoring Commands](../command_line.md#monitoring-commands)). Throughout this section we'll discuss each and every one in further detail:

- [The Status Commands](./status_cmds.md): As you may have guessed, this module will cover the two status commands that Merlin provides ([`merlin status`](../command_line.md#status-merlin-status) and [`merlin detailed-status`](../command_line.md#detailed-status-merlin-detailed-status))

- [Querying Queues and Workers](./queues_and_workers.md): This module will discuss how queues and workers can be queried with the [`merlin queue-info`](../command_line.md#queue-info-merlin-queue-info) and the [`merlin query-workers`](../command_line.md#query-workers-merlin-query-workers) commands.

- [Monitoring Studies for Persistent Allocations](./monitor_for_allocation.md): Here we'll discuss how allocations can be kept alive using the [`merlin monitor`](../command_line.md#monitor-merlin-monitor) command.
