Merlin Documentation
====================
Merlin is a tool for running machine learning based workflows. The goal of
Merlin is to make it easy to build, run, and process the kinds of large
scale HPC workflows needed for cognitive simulation.

Merlin Overview
---------------
Merlin is a distributed task queuing system, designed to allow complex
HPC workflows to scale to large numbers of simulations 
(we've done 100 Million on the Sierra Supercomputer).

Why would you want to run that many simulations?
To become your own Big Data generator.

Data sets of this size can be large enough to train deep neural networks
that can mimic your HPC application, to be used for such
things as design optimization, uncertainty quantification and statistical
experimental inference. Merlin's been used to study inertial confinement
fusion, extreme ultraviolet light generation, structural mechanics and
atomic physics, to name a few.

How does it work?

In essence, Merlin coordinates complex workflows through a persistent
external queue server that lives outside of your HPC systems, but that
can talk to nodes on your cluster(s). As jobs spin up across your ecosystem,
workers on those allocations pull work from a central server, which
coordinates the task dependencies for your workflow. Since this coordination
is done via direct connections to the workers (i.e. not through a file
system), your workflow can scale to very large numbers of workers,
which means a very large number of simulations with very little overhead.

Furthermore, since the workers pull their instructions from the central
server, you can do a lot of other neat things, like having multiple
batch allocations contribute to the same work (think surge computing), or
specialize workers to different machines (think CPU workers for your
application and GPU workers that train your neural network). Another
neat feature is that these workers can add more work back to central
server, which enables a variety of dynamic workflows, such as may be
necessary for the intelligent sampling of design spaces or reinforcement
learning tasks.

Merlin does all of this by leveraging some key HPC and cloud computing
technologies, building off open source components. It uses
`maestro <https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf>`_ to
provide an interface for describing workflows, as well as for defining
workflow task dependencies. It translates those dependencies into concrete
tasks via `celery <https://docs.celeryproject.org/>`_, 
which can be configured for a variety of backend
technologies (`rabbitmq <https://www.rabbitmq.com>`_ and
`redis <https://redis.io>`_ are currently supported). Although not
a hard dependency, we encourage the use of
`flux <http://flux-framework.org>`_ for interfacing with
HPC batch systems, since it can scale to a very large number of jobs.

The integrated system looks a little something like this:
