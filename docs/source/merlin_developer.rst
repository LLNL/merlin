Contributing
============

Welcome to the Merlin developer documentation! This section provides
instructions for contributing to Merlin.

Getting Started
++++++++++++++++


Follow the :doc:`Getting Started <./getting_started>` documentation to setup
your Merlin development environment.

Once your development is setup create a branch:

.. code:: bash

    $ git checkout -b feature/<username>/description

.. note::

    Other common types of branches besides feature are: ``bugfix``,
    ``hotfix``, or ``refactor``.

    Select the branch type that best represents the development.

Merlin follows a `gitflow workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`_.
Updates to the develop branch are made via pull requests.
