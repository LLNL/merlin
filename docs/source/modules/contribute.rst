Contributing
++++++++++++
Merlin is an open source project, so contributions are welcome. Contributions can be anything from bugfixes, documentation, or even new core features.

Contributing to Merlin is easy! Just `send us a pull request <https://github.com/LLNL/merlin/pulls>`_ from your fork. Before you send it, summarize your change in the ``[Unreleased]`` section of ``CHANGELOG.md`` and make sure develop is the destination branch. We aslo appreciate `squash commits <https://github.com/LLNL/merlin/wiki/Squash-commits>`_ before pull requests are merged.

Merlin uses a rough approximation of the Git Flow branching model. The develop branch contains the latest contributions, and master is always tagged and points to the latest stable release.

If you're a contributor, try to test and run on develop. That's where all the magic is happening (and where we hope bugs stop).
