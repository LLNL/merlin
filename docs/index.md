## Why Merlin?

Workflows, applications and machines are becoming more complex, but subject matter experts need to devote time and attention to their applications and often require fine command-line level control. Furthermore, they rarely have the time to devote to learning workflow systems.

With the expansion of data-driven computing, the HPC scientist needs to be able to run more simulations through complex multi-component workflows.

**Merlin targets HPC workflows that require many simulations**.
