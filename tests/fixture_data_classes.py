@dataclass
class RedisBrokerAndBackend:
    """
    Data class to encapsulate all Redis-related fixtures required for
    establishing connections to Redis for both the broker and backend.

    This class simplifies the management of Redis fixtures by grouping
    them into a single object, reducing the number of individual fixture
    imports needed in tests that require Redis functionality.

    Attributes:
        client: A fixture that provides a client for interacting
            with the Redis server.
        server: A fixture providing the connection string to the
            Redis server instance.
        broker_config: A fixture that modifies the configuration
            to point to the Redis server used as the message broker.
        results_backend_config: A fixture that modifies the
            configuration to point to the Redis server used for storing
            results.

    Attributes:
        testing_dir: The path to the temp output directory for feature_demo workflow tests.
        num_samples: An integer representing the number of samples to use in the feature_demo
            workflow.
        name: A string representing the name to use for the feature_demo workflow.
