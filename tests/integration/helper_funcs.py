    Run a Merlin workflow using the `merlin run` and `merlin run-workers` commands.

    This function executes a Merlin workflow using a specified path to a study and variables to

    and start up workers. The tasks are given 15 seconds to be sent to the server. Once tasks
    exist on the server, the workflow is given 30 seconds to run to completion, which should be
    plenty of time.
